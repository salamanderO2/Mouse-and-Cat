 Project Explanation by Phase
🧱 Phase 2: Basic Layout and UI Design
Used Scaffold as the base layout for all screens (main menu, game, instructions).

Structured UI with Container, Column, and Row to position texts, buttons, and timers.

Main game uses a Stack for layered placement of the background, cat, mouse, and overlays.

Added AppBar, FloatingActionButton, and buttons for enhanced UI.

Followed Material Design standards for consistent appearance.

🕹 Phase 3: Interactivity and Navigation
Implemented navigation using Navigator.push and Navigator.pop:

From Main Menu → Instructions → Game

Game → Pause → Resume or Exit

Mouse movement is detected using MouseRegion.onHover, controlling the mouse icon.

Pause/Resume/Exit implemented using state control (isPaused, isCaught flags).

Gameplay is interactive with cat chasing logic and UI state changes triggered by user inputs.

✨ Phase 4: Animation Enhancements
Cat smoothly follows mouse using a position interpolation formula updated every 30ms.

Game speed increases every 10 seconds, making the cat faster (adds difficulty).

Visual animation effect of chasing without complex animation tools.

Game overlays (Pause/Caught) animate with opacity and layered layout effects.

Optional enhancement: can integrate AnimatedContainer, Tween, or AnimationController for richer transitions.

📝 Notes
Game designed for desktop/web (mouse support) — perfect for Flutter Online or Web builds.

Fully functional game loop: Start → Play → Pause/Resume/Exit → Game Over → Restart

Built for clarity, simplicity, and playability.

Solo work by Caloy Loy Rodrigo, BSCS 4F
🧍‍♂️ Why I Worked Solo
I completed this project individually because I was unable to join a group due to financial constraints. Group members were contributing ₱200 each for shared resources, which I could not afford. Rather than miss the opportunity or fail to submit, I chose to work solo and complete the entire project on my own — including design, coding, testing, and documentation. I did my best to meet all the project requirements independently and hope my effort is considered fairly."Even if I were to pay, I still ask for the full work — from screenshots to code and explanation — but what they give me is just a downloadable file that looks like it came from GitHub. So instead of submitting something that seems copied from GitHub, I decided to just work on it myself using the help you provided, so I can still submit something and hopefully get a grade for this project."
